# Community Approved Plugins

Your plugin is **NOT** required to be in this repository. You are free to publish your plugin to `npm` without prior approval. This repository simply aims to be a service to make publishing easier.

## Adding your plugin

1) Create a **Pull Request**
2) Make sure your plugin lives in their own unique directory and that it follows the standards found in the [CREATING PLUGINS](https://github.com/imbateam-gg/titan-reactor/blob/dev/CREATING_PLUGINS.md) documentation.
3) Once approved, your plugin will be published to npm under the **@titan-reactor-community** scope.

## Running these plugins

These plugins are not meant to run in an isolated node or web environment, but within Titan Reactor. You'll need to use the Plugin Manager and install the plugin from the Community tab in order to run any plugin here.
